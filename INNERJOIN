# Example of SQL Query with Inner Join

## To find how many of the top 5 customers in each country:
WITH top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_paid_amount) AS
B.last_name,
(SELECT A.customer_id, B.first_name, D.city, E.country, SUM(amount) AS
total_paid_amount
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id=E.country_id
GROUP BY A.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country HAVING city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Amba_ur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin')
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT(top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON A.customer_id=top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY(all_customer_count) DESC
LIMIT 5;
